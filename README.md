# CS360-Project3

The goal of the mobile app I developed was to provide users with a lightweight, easy-to-use event planner that helped them stay organized and nevr miss important dates. This app was designed to meet the needs of the users who want a simple way to manage their events, meetings, and personal tasks, all from their android devices. 

To address these needs I implemented a user-centered interface featuring a calender view, event creation screen, and dynamic display of scheduled events. Key screens included a login/register screen, the calender interface, and indiviudal event cards with time and delet options. The UI focused on clarity, minamalism, and intuitive design to ensure users could interact with the app quickly and easily. This simplicity made the design successful because it reduced cognitive load and made common tasks like viewing or deleting events, only a tap away. 

During development, I followed a structured approach, starting with layout palnning, folled by gradual feature implementation using Android Studio and Java. I made frequent use of modular coding, event listeners, and SQLite database integreation. These techniques helped ensure clean serperation between UI nad logic, making updates more manageable. I plan to continue using these strategies, especially modular design and regular testing, in future projects.

I tested frequently as to not have a lot of errors at once which would have made debugging a nightmare. A big issue I had was showing the event on when you clicked a date, it wouldnt show the event even when it was inserted.

One area I saw success was the login and account creation page. With it I was able to create a database that intialized oncreate. This part of the app demonstrated my skills in database querying, dynamic UI updating and building interfaces
